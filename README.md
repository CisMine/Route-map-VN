</p>

Going to file searchCode.js and index.html change the  YOUR API KEY into your actual API KEY

If the start, end, and at least one waypoint are all defined then the optimal route will be displayed on the map, and directions will be displayed in a panel to the right of the map.  You can hide/show the panel using the button in the top right of the panel.
